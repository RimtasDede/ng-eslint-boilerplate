# ESlint config for Angular applications

Each developer can have its own code style preferences. This config created by my self for personal usage but feel free if you like it :)

## Add ESlint to your Angular project

```sh
# Install required packages and create common eslint config
ng add @angular-eslint/schematics

# Install plugin for Stylistic rules
npm i -D @stylistic/eslint-plugin
```

> If want have not latest version just choose version you need by sufix @version

Replace `.eslintrc.json` file in your Angular directory. DONE!
